TO-DO-APPLICATION  :
-------------------
Frontend Development:
Utilize HTML to structure the application's layout.
Use CSS for styling the application. Feel free to use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for design components.
Implement the application logic using JavaScript (ES6 or later).

React Components:
Develop the application using functional components and demonstrate the use of React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`).
The application should have at least two components:    
TaskInput: A component for adding a new task.
TaskList: A component for displaying the list of tasks.

State Management:  
Use Redux to manage the application's state. This includes storing the tasks and updating the state when adding or removing tasks.
Implement actions and reducers to handle the state logic.


Functionality:
Add Task: Users should be able to input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or pressing Enter.
View Tasks: Display all added tasks in a list format.
Delete Task: Each task should have a delete button that, when clicked, removes the task from the list.


Edit Task: Each task should have an edit button that, when clicked, task popup opens from the list.
